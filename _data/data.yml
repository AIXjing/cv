career-summary: |
  Fuyang is a software engineer with solid mathematics and physics background.
  He is self-driven, result-oriented. And when doing projects he is good at finding the balance between
  a project's velocity, complexity and quality.
  He has been interested in building machine learning systems for years. Initially learnt many courses
  online about it and nowadays he is building real ones running in production. 
  Recently he fell in love with the Rust programming language 
  and also started learning about distributed NewSQL systems like TiDB/TiKV.

    - 4+ years in software development
    - 3+ years in finite element simulation
    - 2+ years in practicing machine learning

        subtitle: 2015-12 - Present
        summary: | 
          I joined Tradeshift initially working on
          the component for on-boarding companies onto the platform.
          Later on I moved to the Machine Learning team and have been working
          on the components for enhancing automation processes on the platform.
          My work is mainly involved with:
            - Building and maintaining machine learning services (invoice entity classification, business entity matching, product-classification, smart-suggestion)
            - Building Data pipeline on AWS for machine learning components across multiple environments
            - Building micro-services (REST APIs) to allow ML components interacting with other system components
            - Fixing bugs and implement feature requests among different components. Touch on some front-end UI code/Javascript from time to time
